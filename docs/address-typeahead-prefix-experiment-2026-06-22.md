# Address Typeahead Prefix Experiment - 22 June 2026

## TLDR

The likely solution is a combination:

- compact prefix table first for fast, safe, unambiguous prefixes
- rebuilt typeahead FTS fallback for ambiguous prefixes, full-query disambiguation and unit/building safety

Compact prefix alone is not safe enough. It is fast and reaches low P90, but it can silently pick the wrong locality or sibling unit/shop when the first 15 characters are ambiguous.

## Why This Exists

The previous benchmark showed the current 12 GB national SQLite path is accurate but too slow and too late:

- current address P90 is about 26 to 30 typed characters
- current unit/building P90 is about 30, with long P95 tails
- large-index prefix probing has poor latency because it searches the broad G-NAF FTS table

This experiment compares two local-first options before changing production lookup:

1. rebuilt typeahead-specific index
2. compact prefix table

## Harness

Script:

- `scripts/address-typeahead-experiment.mjs`

Repeat command:

```sh
npm run experiment:address-typeahead -- --address-count 700 --noise-per-seed 300 --run-id 2026-06-22-typeahead-prefix-hybrid-700-rankfix
```

Main artefact:

- `tmp/address-typeahead-experiment-2026-06-22-typeahead-prefix-hybrid-700-rankfix.json`

Run shape:

- Source: `data/gnaf/build/gnaf-addresses-national.sqlite`
- Cases: 700 address cases
- Experiment index rows: 2,362 sampled rows
- Experiment SQLite: about 12 MB
- External providers: not used

## Results

| Option | Final exact top | Final resolvable top | Resolvable P50 | Resolvable P90 | Resolvable P95 | Unit resolvable P90 | Latency P95 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Rebuilt typeahead FTS | 647/700 | 700/700 | 5 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 14 ms |
| Compact prefix table | 641/700 | 694/700 | 4 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 6 ms |
| Hybrid prefix + typeahead fallback | 647/700 | 700/700 | 5 | 10 | 10 | 10 | 18 ms |

Interpretation:

- Both rebuilt typeahead and hybrid hit the P90 15 target on this sampled experiment.
- Compact prefix alone also hits P90 10 on successful cases, but it misses final resolvability for 6/700 cases.
- Hybrid keeps the compact prefix speed advantage for unambiguous prefixes and uses typeahead to recover ambiguity.

## Safety Findings

Compact prefix alone failed on cases like:

- `279 Canberra Avenue, Symonston ACT 2609` being outranked by `279 Canberra Avenue, Fyshwick ACT 2609`
- unit/shop-heavy centre addresses where the first 15 characters do not identify the exact unit or shop
- same-site sibling addresses where a prefix row can pick a plausible but wrong exact address

That is not acceptable for route planning. If the prefix table cannot prove one safe base, it must not produce a one-tap exact route target.

## Recommendation

Build the combination:

1. Compact prefix table for prefixes up to 15 characters.
2. Store base signatures for prefix rows.
3. Use prefix rows only when candidate base signatures are unambiguous.
4. For unit/building/shop/office/level records, return `refine_required` base rows unless the typed text identifies the exact unit.
5. Fall back to rebuilt typeahead FTS when the compact prefix is ambiguous, sparse or needs full-query disambiguation.
6. Keep exact unit P90 separate from resolvable P90 in benchmarks.

Decision:

- Not prefix-only.
- Not the current broad G-NAF FTS.
- A rebuilt typeahead index is required.
- A compact prefix table is still valuable as the fast path.

## Caveats

- This is a sampled experiment, not a full national rebuild.
- The sampled index is much smaller than the 12 GB national SQLite, so the exact latency numbers are directional.
- The result proves the design direction, not production readiness.
- A full national typeahead/prefix build still needs size, build-time and lookup benchmarks.

## Next Build Step

Create the production-shaped local index:

- `address_typeahead_entries`
- `address_prefix_entries`
- shared `base_signature`
- explicit `entry_type`: `exact`, `base_refine`, `street`, `locality`
- explicit `refine_required`

Then rerun:

- 700 address benchmark
- 1000 address-only benchmark
- unit/building/shop tail report
- latency P50/P95
- wrong-top-before-resolvable count
